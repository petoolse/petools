# Meet the new release of good old-fashioned PE Tools

It's been years since NEOx released latest public version of PE Tools in 2006, so you may have decided that PET is already dead, but it came back from the dead for a while in 2018!

## Principal Changes

### Fixes

> Primarily, new release is about bug fixes. There are lot of things fixed including memory leaks and program logic. Be warned, sometimes new bugs are replacing old ones, but we had worked hard to bring you bug-free release without introducing new bugs (we really hope so).

### New Features

Some nice new features are added to make your experience more visible and comfortable:

- [x] Brand new **Entropy View** (approximately detect packing status, presence of encrypted data) with two modes: Curve and Histogram;

- [x] New disassembler engine (previously it was CADt by Ms-Rem, then Mediana by mika0x65 and now it's diStorm by Gil Dabah) has now resulted in x86-64 (64 bit) disasm in addition to x86 (32 bit);
